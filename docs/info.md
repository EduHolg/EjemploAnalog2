## How it works

Circuit that compares two voltages or currents and produces a binary output indicating which input is greater.

## How to test

To test a comparator, apply known input voltages and check if the output logic level matches the expected result based on the input conditions. Vary the input voltages across the entire range and verify the output transitions occur at the specified threshold voltage.

## External hardware
